# Fitbit heartrate graphs

Make heartrate graphs (and export to csv) from your exported fitbit user data.

## Usage

1. Copy `.env-default` and rename it to `.env`.
2. Puth the path to `user-site-export` (might be `Physical Activity` now) from your downloaded fitbit userdata in the `.env` file.
3. Enable what you want the script to do at the top of `getData.R`.
4. Run the script.
